<!-- Hello, fellow nerd.  If you're here, I assume you wanted to
		make sure I actually coded this by hand.  I assure you I did.
		Once you're done taking a look, let me know what you think.
		I'm interested in your opinions.

		Also, if you want to hire me...that would be great, too.
		I'm looking for freelance work and I am also interested in
		working for a web development company.

		Contact me: hello@davidmancini.xyz  Thanks!-->
