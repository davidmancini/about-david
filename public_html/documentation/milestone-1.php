				<span class="sectionLabel">Job: </span>Apartment Leasing Manager<br><br>

		<!--USE CASE-->
		<div class="sectionHead">Use Case</div>
		<div class="sectionBody">
			<p>
				<span class="sectionLabel">Time: </span>Monday morning<br><br>
				<span class="sectionLabel">Location: </span>Office at the apartment complex<br><br>
				<span class="sectionLabel">Situation: </span>Millie has been tasked by her boss to get their complex's website redesigned and more functional.  Right now, their site is flat and offers only basic information about the complex and their office hours.<br><br>
				<span class="sectionLabel">Goals: </span>They would like to have a more dynamic site in which a visitor could see information about their currently-available units, including the price and other features.  They would also like an interface for residents to be able to submit maintenance requests and pay their rent online.<br><br>
				<span class="sectionLabel">Frustrations: </span>Millie's manager tasked her with this website project without taking away any of her regular responsibilities; she does not have the time or energy to dedicate to this project.  While it may seem that she cannot provide much time or direction to the project, she needs the finished product to look good and perform to her and her boss' expectations.<br><br>
				<span class="sectionLabel">Additional Info Needed: </span>Millie needs to know her budget and target completion time-frame, as well as necessary technology information (hosting provider and passwords, for example)
