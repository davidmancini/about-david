		<h1>Milestone Two</h1>

		<!-- SITEMAP -->
		<div class="sectionHead">Sitemap</div>
		<div class="sectionBody">
			One page with the following sections:
			<ul>
				<li>Introduction/Biography</li>
				<li>Skills</li>
				<li>Projects</li>
				<li>Pricing</li>
				<li>Quote/Contact Me</li>
			</ul>

		<!--CONTENT STRATEGY -->
		<div class="sectionHead">Content Strategy</div>
		<div class="sectionBody">
			<div class="sectionLabel">Introduction/Biography</div>
				A brief introduction of my history in the medical field and my interest in technology.  The strategy is to show my various passions and dedication to follow through with a wide variety of projects.<br><br>
			<div class="sectionLabel">Skills</div>
				Here, I would list both broad skills, like UX/UI and Databases, but also specific languages and programs.  The goal here would be to cater to visitors with different knowledge levels--both tech-savvy and someone who knows nothing of how the web works but just wants to hire a developer.  This could also help with SEO and serve as keywords.<br><br>
			<div class="sectionLabel">Projects</div>
				This would serve as a portfolio section.  It should have screenshots of projects I've worked on and some information on technology used (again, in both tech terms and in plain English).<br><br>
			<div class="sectionLabel">Pricing</div>
				I feel that people want to know right away how much my services will cost.  Although each project will have a different cost, depending on what the client wants, having a clear and open pricing guide is important to include.  It should be clear that this is only a guide and that they need to get a quote for their specific project.<br><br>
			<div class="sectionLabel">Quote/Contact Me</div>
				Listed contact info and also a quick web form to send me an email (and also log this info in a database) with basic information about their project so that I can get back to them with a quote.
