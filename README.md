### Milestone 1 Feedback

&#10004; Correctly set up the git/GitHub/PhpStorm toolchain.

&#10004; Create the directory structure for the project as outlined.

&#10004; Define a purpose, audience, and goal for your project.

&#10004; Create one Persona for your proposed project.

&#10004; Create one Use Case for your proposed project, based on the Persona.

Wow - excellent job here on both the content AND the layout. Your purpose/audience/goal and Persona and Use Case are all crystal clear and very well thought out. Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). Go ahead and get started on Milestone 2a.

#### Edits/Suggestions
- Your HTML code looks really good overall. The only issue I see is that the &lt;footer&gt; belongs inside the &lt;body&gt; (you closed the &lt;body&gt; tag too soon). Your CSS looks great.

### Milestone 2&alpha; Feedback

&#10004; Create a sitemap outlining the pages you plan to include in your PWP.

&#10004; Document a brief plan or strategy for your content that will support the overall purpose and goal of the site.

&#10004; Map out a simple interaction flow that details the steps a user must take to successfully use your site to acheive the goal.

&#10004; Create a mobile and desktop/laptop wireframe for each page layout.

Again, everything is extremely well thought out and presented. Go ahead and start coding!
